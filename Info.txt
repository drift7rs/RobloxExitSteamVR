Simple script to automatically close SteamVR when Roblox launches it. 

Install instructions: Download latest release from releases, extract .zip file and follow README.txt for instructions. 

THIS IS NOT 100% MADE BY ME!!!
ChatGPT was used in the making of this, specifically "RobloxExitSteamVR.bat".
